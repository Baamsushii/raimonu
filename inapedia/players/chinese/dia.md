# Dia

Dia is a Chinese :cn: player, maining Nomash. 
He is considered the godfather of the Chinese community, 
and his aggressive yet methodical playstyle, known as the Chinese playstyle, has been adopted by all the other Chinese players.

## Style of Play

Dia plays exclusively Nomash. His gameplay is fast but methodical, opting to eliminate risks
and create opportunities for "guaranteed" 1-on-1 goals. Chain dashing is therefore very important
for him, and his dash nomash techniques are clinical and always consistent. He also goes for
body mirrors very often whenever he plays another Nomasher.
