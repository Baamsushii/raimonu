# Infi

Infi is a Japanese :jp: player, maining all 3 playstyles. 
He is known for his slow and methodical playstyle, and is often considered as one of the best players in the world. 

## Style of Play

Slow and methodical, Infi's gameplay is the definition of textbook. His game knowledge is unparalleled, knowing every little detail and interaction by heart. 
He incorporates this into the game by committing to decisions others would be unsure of and
pushing the game's mechanics to its absolute limits.

His Nomash is distinct from the majority of other Nomashers today, with a heavy emphasis on 
side nomash techniques, most notably the Kamui. In that regard, Infi is also extremely proficient with Kirafi compositions.

Defensively, Infi is very patient and always cautious with his gauge usage, often opting not
to initiate his circle until the last moment.
