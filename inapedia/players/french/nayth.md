He is considered the godfather of the French playstyle, having pioneered
the aggressive and dash-heavy Nomash that is the norm in France today.
He was part of the "old generation" of French players.

## Style of Play

As the progenitor of the French style, nayth utilizes fast attacks and dashing
to constantly be in the face of his opponent. His signature use of DSBs to score
was also passed down and heavily used by the next generation of French players.

He is also known for being easily titled in-game, with the most notable incident being
his infamous rage quit at the 2021 World Cup Finals.

nayth's signature character is Shuu (his previous username's namesake), having used him even in Vanilla.
