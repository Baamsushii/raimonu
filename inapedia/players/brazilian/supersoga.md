# Supersoga

Supersoga is a Brazilian :brazil: player.
He plays a style that is known within the Brazilian community as "sogaismo". He is also a commentator.

## Style of Play

Supersoga tends to play defense-heavy team comps, often drafting 8-9 defenders in his team and playing only on his side of the field. This playstyle, sogaismo, therefore came to be named after him.

Supersoga is also known for his signature Zanark pick to score at the start of the game, which is effective in the Backdraft format due to the relative lack of miximax players to interrupt solo shots.
