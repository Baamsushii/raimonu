# Draft Cup

Draft Cup is a Japanese :jp: tournament series organized by the Japanese community.
It serves as the most important and prestigious tournament series in Japan.

Draft Cup utilizes a pre-season drafting system, where players take turns drafting characters to make up a team of 16 (occasionally 17) characters.

Aside from Japanese players, a few Chinese players have been invited to participate in several previous editions.
