# Draft Cup

Draft Cup is a Japanese :jp: tournament series organized by the Japanese community.
It serves as the most prestigious national-level tournament series in Japan.

Draft Cup utilizes a pre-game drafting system, where players take turns drafting characters until to make up a team of 16 (occasionally 17) players.

Aside from Japanese players, a few Chinese players have been invited to participate in several previous editions.
