We Draft For You 2.0 was a tournament held by the Inazuma Eleven Asia discord server. It adopted the special We Draft For You (hence the name) ruleset, but unlike the [previous edition](wdfy.md), participants drafted their own teams for a panel of judges to rate. Participants then get to pick a team made by other participants, with the highest rated participant choosing first. 20 players participated.
