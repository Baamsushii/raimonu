Inasuto_108 was a tournament held by the French community but was open to all. It broke the record for the biggest international tournament at the time. 32 players participated.

Tier: Major
###### NOTE: Despite this tournament having only 32 players, this number was notably large in 2021, and thus deserves a special case of being classified as a Major. However, only the top 8 will be displayed as per Minors.
