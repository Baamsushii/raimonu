# Nomash

###### NOTE: In this article, “Nomash” with a capital “N” refers to the playstyle as a whole, while “nomash” without any capitalizations refers to the literal meaning of the term.

Derived from the Japanese form of “normal shoot”, this playstyle mostly does not use shoot hissatsus to score. 
Instead, it relies on using normal shots and abusing mechanics that “evade” the enemy GK in order to score. 

Here is an example of that:

This technique is known as Single Rush (Tantai Toshin), and is one of the most common nomash. 
The player dashes away right as the GK crouches down, which prevents the ball from being taken and gives enough time for the player to dash to the goal. 

Here’s another common nomash:

This one is known as Uranus Shot (also known as Emperor Nomash). 
This technique involves one of your players colliding with the enemy GK, which prevents causes the ball to ignore the GK and go into the goal. 

There are many techniques that utilize these kinds of mechanics (or bugs, as some call it) in order to score, and that is the main point of the Nomash playstyle. 

## Team Compositions

Here are some of the meta team compositions for nomash (Vanilla):

<img width="480" alt="team comp 1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/184292767-375f3d30-9577-48fe-9851-b4dfd58876e4.png">

<img width="480" alt="team comp 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/184292728-f47a4f4b-53ac-465c-9940-247bc89c5450.png">

<img width="480" alt="team comp 3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/184292735-5fd55a2c-ddfb-447c-86b6-e76e3a37d939.png">



Because scoring does not use SH hissatsus, powerful shooters are not needed in the team. 
Instead, the offense is made up of powerful dribblers with high Body stats and strong OF hissatsus. 

The best examples of this include 
Tenma <img width="42" alt="rtenma" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/184293421-0c694d79-b48a-4403-8e1b-09fae3e6eee3.png">
, Kitaki <img width="42" alt="kitaki" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/184294505-2528be76-e504-447e-bac5-c1b8f147b04e.png">
and Laven <img width="42" alt="raben" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/184294521-2e01669a-8beb-48e3-ac98-72de9700130f.png">. 
All 3 of these also possess the ability to dash, which allows them to perform techniques such as Single Rush. 

Dribblers that cannot dash are still powerful in their own right and can score in other ways (such as Uranus Shots). 
The strongest of these are 
Kruger <img width="42" alt="kruger" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/184294410-5bd501ac-bf90-4f43-8b8c-b0b8bcc6b80a.png">
and ILJ Fudou <img width="42" alt="fudou" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/184294472-a29699af-5531-4ae5-82dc-9e9f1c4a7e3d.png">. 

A key factor that determines the strength of a dribbler in the meta is how strong they are against the Deep Jungle defenders. 
This is because basically every competitive team uses DJ as their defense. 
All 5 of the aforementioned players either win or are equal against the DJ users (Torb, ILJ Kazemaru, ILJ Sakuma, JPN/ILJ Tsunami) with the exception of Kabeyama, 
who is rarely used. 

Here is a subjective tier list made by Paraly (Vanilla):

<img width="480" alt="tier list MF" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/184293146-da16dec3-d7e1-44fa-8ea7-f322f000277a.png">

NOTE: Fubuki <img width="42" alt="r2 fubuki" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/184293332-619649af-5471-4961-8d26-e196bc067ff6.png">
is typically played in Chain/Hybrid teams as a chain starter and +4 Guard keyman. 
Beta <img width="42" alt="beta" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/184294567-5f61e9f4-5d15-4336-aad1-bd5121cac90e.png">
serves a very different role from the rest of the dribblers in the tier list (she is widely not considered as a dribbler). 

## Difficulty

Some nomash techniques, such as Single Rush, are tricky to learn and difficult to master and perform consistently. 

Compared to Chain, Nomash is more reliant on mechanics and techniques. Thus it has a higher learning curve and arguably a higher skill cap. 

At the highest level, there is a wide variety of intricate techniques that are used depending on the situation. 
The best players have many ways of scoring that they can use from their playbook. 
As a result, Nomash can be considered as more difficult than Chain, and arguably easier than Hybrid. 

Despite that, Nomash may still be recommended for beginners as there are also techniques that are simple to learn and execute, 
such as High Jump and Through Ball Shoot.

## Usage Rate

As of the time of this writing, Nomash is the most commonly used playstyle out of the 3. This is especially true at the highest level where almost all top players main Nomash.
