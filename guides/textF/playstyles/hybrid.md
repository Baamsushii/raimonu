# Hybrid

###### NOTE: If you have not read the articles for _Chain_ and _Nomash_, I suggest you to do so first before reading this.

Hybrid is a combination of the Nomash and Chain playstyles. In other words, Hybrid players can rely on either nomashing or chaining to score goals.

## Team Compositions

Here are some of the meta team compositions for hybrid (Vanilla):

Typically, hybrid and nomash team comps are nearly identical with the exception of a strong chain shooter being positioned as a FW. 

This circumvents Chainâ€™s weakness of being unable to effectively dribble offensively, while also adding another dimension of attacking to Nomash via chain shooting. 

However, that also means that both dribbling and chain performance is weaker than when playing Nomash and Chain, respectively. 
The side (top or bottom) that utilizes a chain shooter is inferior in terms of dribbling (especially if that chainer is Canon). 

Furthermore, chaining can only be done from one side (two, if chain starting from the center is counted) of the field since there is only one chainer, 
as opposed to from all sides of the field when playing Chain. 

## Difficulty

As a result, Hybrid is considered to be the most difficult out of the 3 playstyles. 
It involves utilizing the techniques required of Nomash together with the timings required of Chain. 

It is often recommended to understand both playstyles at a high level first before learning Hybrid. 

## Usage Rate

There are very few Hybrid users from the beginner to middle skill range, and it is mostly used in upper-middle levels and above.
